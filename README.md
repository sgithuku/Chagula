# What is Chagula?

Chagula is a meal planner I built to help put some structure around how we decide what we eat every week. Lockdowns mean less going out and so we have tried to make sure there is variety in what we eat.

### Why Chagula?

It's a Swahili abstraction of Chakula (food) and Chagua (to choose) - we couldn't think of anything better!

### Features

### Roadmap

The plan is to add the following features as a priority:

- Track what you ate this week
- Choose custom images for your recipes
- Theming

This is a [Blitz.js](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz) app.

### How to use

blitz db seed
